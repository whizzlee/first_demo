You don't know what pain is, you just fuck with famous
I don't know you, I can tell your energy is dangerous
You don't know how long it took to finally come alive
So b- don't kill my vibe
Yeah, I can feel the changes, and I can tell you hate it
Save your breath, I'm sick to death of fake congratulations
You don't know how much I had to give to come alive
So b- don't kill my vibe
Trick don't kill my vibe, trick don't kill my vibe
Trick don't kill my vibe, trick don't kill my vibe

Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' with you
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
