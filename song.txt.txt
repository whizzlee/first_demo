You don't know what pain is, you just fuck with famous
I don't know you, I can tell your energy is dangerous
You don't know how long it took to finally come alive
So b- don't kill my vibe
Yeah, I can feel the changes, and I can tell you hate it
Save your breath, I'm sick to death of fake congratulations
You don't know how much I had to give to come alive
So b- don't kill my vibe
Trick don't kill my vibe, trick don't kill my vibe
Trick don't kill my vibe, trick don't kill my vibe
